# Billing and Currency Exchange Service with Test Cases

This Spring Boot application calculates billing amounts for users based on item categories, applies specific discount rules based on user types, and converts the final amount to a target currency using real-time exchange rates fetched from an external API.


## Features
- Calculate total and final bill amounts after applying discounts.
- Apply percentage-based discounts based on user type.
- Apply flat $5 discount for every $100 on the bill.
- Convert bill total to a target currency using real-time exchange rates.
- Cache exchange rates to reduce API calls.
- Secure endpoints with Basic Authentication.
- Easy configuration through `application.properties`.
- Full test coverage with JUnit and Mockito.
- Gracefully handles errors, exceptions such as missing exchange rates or reflection field access issues.
